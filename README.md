🚀 Telco Customer Churn Analysis – A Data-Driven Approach to Customer Retention 📊

I’m excited to share my recent project focused on analyzing customer churn in the telecom sector using Python and data analysis techniques.

🧠 What’s the problem?
Customer churn is a critical metric for telecom companies. Retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This analysis helps understand why customers leave and what factors contribute most to their decision.

📌 Objectives of the Project:
1. Identify key features influencing churn
2. Uncover insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Visualize patterns and relationships in the data
4. Support decision-making through actionable insights

🔍 Tools & Technologies Used:
1. Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
2. Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis
3. Count plots, distribution plots, and heatmaps for visualization

📈 Key Insights Gained:
1. Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn compared to those on long-term contracts.
2. Lack of tech support and online security increases the chances of churn.
3. Higher monthly charges correlate with increased churn rates.
4. Internet service type, tenure, and contract type are major influencing factors.

💡 Outcome:
The analysis reveals the behavioral patterns and service-related factors driving churn. It provides telecom businesses with insight into where to focus retention strategies—be it better onboarding, bundling services, or offering discounts for longer contracts.
